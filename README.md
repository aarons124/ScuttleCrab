# 👋 Welcome to Scuttle Crab!

**Scuttle Crab** is a dedicated `League Of Legends` bot using the official Riot Games API.
This also has more variety of commands, below you can see them.

# 🔰 About Me

The project started 6 months ago when my main developer `(Fabrizio#1663)` started to be interested in the use of APIs in Discord Bots, following this, he decided to tell about this project to his great friend `Kirzu~#3444` and he agreed to help him and so I became what I am now.
